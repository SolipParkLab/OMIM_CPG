# OMIM_CPG

This repository contains R codes for the regression and gene clustering analysis performed in Song et al, 2023 (submitted).

The R_code folder contains two different scripts; 1. Regression_code.R to estimate the enrichment of pathogenic germline variants in cancer (per gene) and 2. Gene_Clustering_code.R to classify the characteristics of significantly enriched genes in cancer by PCA clustering method.
The variable used in the Regression_code.R can also be adjusted to Disease and Functional annotation analysis.

Input files for these R codes are included in the R_code_input folder, and values were generated for these input files according to pathogenic variant carriers and no-carriers described in the Methods.
